**Sulla** is a named robot from Karel Čapek's 1920 play R.U.R. (Rossum's Universal Robots)—the exact work that invented the word "robot."

In the story, Sulla is one of the first advanced, articulate robots produced by Rossum's factory. She demonstrates early signs of independent thought, clear speech, and emotional nuance—far beyond basic machines. She appears in Act I as a showcase of what these artificial beings can become: intelligent, responsive, almost human assistants.

Pronunciation: **SOO-luh**

- SOO like "sue" or "super"
- luh like the "la" in "lava"
- Phonetic: /ˈsuː.lə/
